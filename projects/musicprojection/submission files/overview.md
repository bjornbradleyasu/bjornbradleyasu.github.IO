This project was designed for my entertainment and for my art side as this does not serve a life or death purpose but it is beautiful. On my wall at home I have vinyl records hanging up. And this project takes my projector and projects a dispaly onto them. This display is controlled by the control page which communicates to the display page through a server running on ec2. I was not able to integrate shazam or anything to crazy into the design yet but I hope to do this in the near future. As it is at the moment, on the control page the user can search and select their albums and place them on a grid where they are then transfered to the grid on the display page. For future integration i want to add a soundwave banner at the top and maybe other features.
